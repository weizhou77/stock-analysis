## Analysis

### OverView  and Purpose of the Project

We have created a VBS code to analyze the green energy stock market for year 2017 and 2018. The purpose of this project is to refactor the code we have created for the project.




### Results about the Output

When we run the analysis, the program will ask you to input the year you want to analyze. After entering the year you want to analyze, the program will output all the Total Daily Volume and Yearly Return for each stock. Also Excel will pop up a message box telling you how much time Excel has used to execute the code. 



### Summary about the Refactering Code

In general, the refactored code should be more efficient, easier to understand with comments and better organized structure. The disadvantage for refactoring code is that it takes longer time to restructure the code and it may cause some bug such as typo during the refactoring process. Comparing the refactored VBS code to the original from the exercise, we have created an extra array variable called tickersIndex which will allow us to modify our code easily in the future if we need to change the tickers datas. Also, we added more comments to the code which will make the code more understandable. Since our original VBS code for the project is not very long, we do not see a significant execution time improvement from the refactored code.
