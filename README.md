## Analysis

### Over View of the Project

The purpose of this project is about Steve is helping his parents doing some investments on green energy stock, the Daqo New Energy Corporation stock in particular. Our goal is to decide whether the Daqo New Energy Corporation stock is a good green energy stock to invest by analyzing two groups of green energy data for year 2017 and 2018. We are going to use Visual Basic for Applications programming language to do this project. VBA interacts with excel, it can read and write to cells and worksheets, make calculations and use complex logic to perform analysis.



### Results about the Output

There are two worksheets in the datasets, one worksheet shows 2017 stock market and the other shows 2018. Each worksheet has 12 green energy stocks including the Daqo New Energy Corporation stock (DQ). We use VBA to make calculations for the total daily volume and yearly return for each stocks. On the 2017 output, it shows that it is a good year for green energy stocks. Almost all 12 green energy stocks have positive yearly return except the TEBP stock. DQ almost has 200% yearly return. however, when we look at the 2018 output, DQ has negative yearly return that it is -62.6%. In 2018, there are only two green energy stocks have positive yearly return which are ENPH (81.9%) and RUN (84%); not just positive yearly return, their total daily volumes are almost doubled as in 2017. So we will suggest Steve to invest in ENPH and RUN instead of DQ for their parents.


### Summary about the Refactering Code

The refactoring code allows us to analyze and show analysis data output in one worksheet. However, it can only show one analysis data output for one year at a time so we can not compare both years side by side.
